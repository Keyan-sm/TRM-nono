	1.	Understand the training dataset thoroughly in @NonoDataset-main. This is confusing, it is split into many files. . 

	2.	Test Gemini 3 performance on the training dataset 
        - look at gem3 on 10x10 then 15x15 boards
        - This may be incomplete/anicdotal test just to see where we are at
        - We can poss hold off on full test acuracy of gem3 and opus 4.5 until later
        - just need to know the baseline so we can understand how to think abt training TRM on this set 
        - IE if gem3 is 90% acc on 10x10 boards, then we know we need to beat that or go to 15x15 board 
	3.	Based on Gemini’s performance, determine how the TRM architecture for this task should differ (if at all) from:
	    - The published architectures in the Samsung paper
