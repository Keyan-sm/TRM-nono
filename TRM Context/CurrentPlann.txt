	1.	Understand the training dataset thoroughly in @NonoDataset-main. This is confusing, it is split into many files. . 

	2.	Test Gemini 3 performance on the training dataset 
        - look at gem3 on 10x10 then 15x15 boards
        - This may be incomplete/anicdotal test just to see where we are at
        - We can poss hold off on full test acuracy of gem3 and opus 4.5 until later
        - just need to know the baseline so we can understand how to think abt training TRM on this set 
        - IE if gem3 is 90% acc on 10x10 boards, then we know we need to beat that or go to 15x15 board 
	3.	Based on Gemini’s performance, determine how the TRM architecture for this task should differ (if at all) from:
	    - The published architectures in the Samsung paper

Inference Results (Epoch 1):

Prediction: Still predicting all zeros.
Accuracy: 33.00%.
It seems the model hasn't broken out of the "safe" zero-prediction strategy yet. This can happen in the early stages, especially if the class imbalance (more zeros than ones, or vice versa) pushes it towards a default value, or if the reasoning depth needs more time to stabilize.



2. Use the @10x10 dataset to train a new simple proof of concept TRM model. 
- create in a new folder under TRMProj, create copies of relevant scripts. Do not interfere with or edit the current codebase. 
    - proof of concept means we don't need to get to 100% accuracy, we just need to show that it can learn something; train on a small portion of the entire dataset (10%?)
    - Use the same architecture and methodology as the published Samsung paper
    - Note the format of the @10x10 dataset
